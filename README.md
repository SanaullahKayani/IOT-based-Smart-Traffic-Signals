# IOT-based-Smart-Traffic-Signals
The project is aimed at designing a density based dynamic traffic signal system where the timing of signal will change automatically on sensing the traffic density at any junction. And the record of junction will display on Website in graphical form as well as in tabular format.
Density base traffic signal control is made by using Arduino Mega2560, Wemos Wi-Fi. And Website has a lot of PHP, javascript and many other designing language.
Arduino Send data to ESP over UART communication and ESP future transmits it to the Website in JSON format.
